Now that we've gone over what exactly R is and outlined the package functionality that makes it useful for working with data, we are going to cover information needed to actually start working in R. To work with data in R, you'll need an understanding of objects.

Simply put, an object in R, is something that contains information. In R there are a number of basic (also called atomic) classes of objects. Four classes that you'll be working with commonly are character, integer, numeric which are for real numbers, and logical which are for true and false values. These atomic classes are the building blocks for creating all sorts of objects in R. The simplest type of object in R is called a vector, which is an object that can contain multiple items. Generally, vectors can only contain objects of the same class, but a certain type of vector, called a list, can contain objects of different classes. We won't discuss lists for now. We'll begin by looking at how to create objects in each of these four atomic classes in R.

In R, as with all programming languages, it is important to be able to store objects that we create so that we can use them in later code. The process of storing an object is called assignment, and it entails giving an object a name. For example, the following code creates an object called min underscore age and stores inside it the value 21. The left pointing arrow operator is called the assignment operator. The equals sign operator can also be used for assignment. Having this minimum age variable stored in an object can be useful later if we have data where we only want to keep individuals who exceed this minimum age.

Character objects in R can be created by surrounding a string in either double quotes or single quotes. The second example shows how to store a sentence character object in an object named my underscore car. My car is a character vector of length 1. We can create a character vector named my car vec with multiple character objects using the concatenate function, c. We'll discuss functions more in later lessons.

Integer objects in R can be created by specifying an integer number followed by the letter L. The following creates an integer object called num and stores the value 1. Without the letter L, the number will be recognized as a more generic, numeric object. We can create an integer vector with multiple items using the c function. The last example creates an integer vector of length 3 with the numbers 1, 10, and 3.

Numeric objects in R represent real numbers and are created by simply entering a number. We can create a numeric vector with multiple items using the c function.

Logical objects in R represent true or false conditions and can be created by typing true or false in all capital letters. We can create a logical vector with multiple items using the c function.

Now that we've covered common basic data classes, we will now discuss data frames. Data frames are a more complex data type than the simple vectors than we've seen so far. Data frames organize data into a rectangular format where each column corresponds to a single variable and each row corresponds to an observation. So a row of a data frame contains an observation's values for all variables. An example of a data frame is shown here. Along the columns there are different variables related to car properties, and each row gives information on those properties for a particular car model. Every column in a data frame is a simple vector of values all from the same class. You will learn more about working with data frames in the next lesson and in later courses.
